# flickr-hacks-ruby

A Ruby implementation of some of the tips and tools found in the book [Flickr Hacks](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596102456.do) by Paul Bausch and Jim Bumgardner.

## Completed
* [Hack 33 - Download a List of Photos](https://github.com/efung/flickr-hacks-ruby/tree/master/hack33)

## Planned
* Hack 34 - Cache Photos Locally
* Hack 44 - Find the Dominant Color of an Image
* Hack 45 - Make a Color Picker
* Hack 49 - Make a Photo Mosaic

# Motivation
I've been a big fan of Bumgardner (a.k.a krazydad) and his work (viewable [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/krazydad/collections/72157622192771853/)). After emailing him asking how I could create my own mosaics, he told me he used the  scripts that could be found in his book. The (mostly Perl) examples are downloadable from O'Reilly [here](http://examples.oreilly.com/9780596102456/).

As I am getting my feet wet with Ruby, I decided to buy a copy of the book from an online used bookstore and port the hacks to a more modern language.
